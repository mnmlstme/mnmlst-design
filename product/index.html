          <a href="http://ascend.io">Ascend</a> is a Palo Alto startup which
          offers a cloud-based platform for data engineers to design and
          productionize complex data pipelines. Having joined as a front-end
          developer while Ascend was still in <q>stealth mode</q>, I
          transitioned to Product Management and Design, and was the sole
          Product Manager when the product was
          <a href="http://www.ascend.io/blog/introducing-the-autonomous-dataflow-service">launched</a>.

          We had several projects still in flight at the time of the product
          launch, and needed a way to communicate a coherent product vision to
          the press and customers. Though we had wireframes, and some partial
          implementation, for each of the new features, we needed high-fidelity
          visuals which, while still somewhat aspirational, would be
          representative of the future UI.
        </p>

        <p>
          While my usual process is to go straight from wireframes to code (by
          way of a <a href="../systems">design system</a>), these vision mockups
          gave stakeholders a much clearer picture of what Product was planning.
          It was also helpful for the development team to unite around a shared
          vision of what they were building.

        <p>
          One of the more challenging features to design for Ascend was the
          timeline, which helps users observe where the system is spending time
          and resources. Since there are dependencies between operations, a
          Gantt chart was a natural choice. But start and stop times alone did
          not give users enough insight, because each operation was executed in
          pieces, with individual jobs being run simultaneously or in sequence
          as the logic of the operation and the system's available resources
          required. Representing all this activity as a single bar was losing
          too much information; but overplotting bar segments for each job would
          clutter the display and make the dependences harder to see.
        </p>

        <p>
          The solution was keep the Gantt chart focused on the overall progress
          of the computation, but provide an affordance to drill down to get
          aggregate and individual job metrics. Working through the
          implementation required a collaborative effort with engineering to
          understand the constraints, propose various solutions, and evaluate
          them on the basis of level of effort and benefit to users in terms of
          the resulting depth of detail.

        <p>
          With a highly technical product like Ascend's, it can be challenging
          to conceptualize the system in a way which is neither too detailed nor
          too abstract. The Engineering team has their architectural diagrams,
          but we don't want to overload users with details that are not
          pertinent to their understanding of the system. On the other hand, if
          we give too little information, users will not be able to reason about
          how their interaction with the system affects its operation. A concise
          conceptual model, even if not presented to users directly, provides a
          foundation to the user experience, and a context for the vocabulary
          used in the interface.

        <p>
          Our initial data product offering was retail traffic time series data
          derived from satellite imagery of parking lots. While this data was
          mostly consumed via an API, a visualization UI was essential for
          customers to evaluate the data prior to purchasing the live data feed.
          This UI consisted of a series of charts which demonstrated the
          insights that could be drawn from the data, as determined by the
          Product Manager and Data Science team.

        <p>
          When we released our second data product, which required different
          analytics, the team created a new UI to showcase those unique
          insights. After creating the third bespoke data visualization UI, the
          Frontend Engineering team nearly revolted&mdash;we can't keep doing
          this!

          As a result, we designed a data portal product for geospatial analytic
          data. We identified key abstractions that were relevant to all of our
          data products&mdash;geographic regions, time series, unitless indices,
          categories&mdash;and devised navigation mechanisms along those axes.
          Working with the Product Managers from each of the domains, we found
          ways to maintain the unique visualizations for each product, while
          factoring out the common ones, a win for both the customer and our
          development team.
