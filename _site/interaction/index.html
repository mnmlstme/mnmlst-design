          had been developing geoanalytics tools for government agencies, but
          was having difficulty breaking into the commercial market. There was
          certainly demand, but there was also considerable friction and cost
          for private sector customers to acquire the raw satellite imagery on
          which the algorithms operated.

          We proposed a

            href="https://www.airbus.com/newsroom/press-releases/en/2019/04/airbus-and-orbital-insight-launch-earth-monitor-to-provide-geopolitical-and-economic-insights.html"
            >collaborative effort</a
          >
          with a major satellite operator to enable users to run our algorithms
          on large numbers of images without ever downloading the
          full-resolution images themselves. This was much more cost-effective
          for our customers than purchasing large quantities of imagery for
          download to our platform, and it gave the satellite another market for
          imagery already in their catalog.
        </p>

        <p>
          Working closely with our business development team, I produced
          storyboards which demonstrated the feasibility of the service, and
          also highlighted the touch points between the two companies. These
          storyboards are intentionally low-fidelity: some steps just show part
          of a form, while others show an entire screen. The primary focus is
          the series of interactions required for the user to accomplish their
          task.

          offers a cloud-based platform for data engineers to design and
          productionize complex data pipelines. I was the first designer hired
          by the company. Without design from which to work, development hinged
          on a series of back-and-forth discussions between Engineering teams,
          while the Product team and other stakeholders did not have adequate
          visibility into what was being developed until the code was written.

          By producing wireframes for new features, we decoupled Frontend
          development from the teams that were producing the APIs. This
          accelerated development because the teams were now able to work in
          parallel. In addition, other stakeholders could review the wireframes
          to determine whether the feature would meet customer needs.

        <p>
          Smaller interactions can still be complex, such as the case where a
          radio button determines the next set of options. Wireframes can still
          be appropriate, but rather than depicting a full screen, we zoom in on
          a single element and how it is affected by the user's interaction.
          Annotations can also help reduce the number of views required to
          completely document an interaction.
        </p>

        <p>
          With today's tools and design systems, it can be tempting to increase
          the fidelity of wireframes to the point where they are
          indistinguishable from the completed UI. But this works
          cross-purposes. First, it sends the wrong message to stakeholders, by
          giving them the impression that the design is final, and discouraging
          comment. In addition, it is easier to extract engineering requirements
          from a stripped-down UI. And after all, if there is a
          <a href="../systems">design system</a> in place, we want that to drive
          pixel-level design, and not have the team trying to match
          pixel-perfect mocks.

          VMware Horizon is an enterprise SSO and application management
          solution. While Horizon was initially successful with desktop
          environments, enterprise IT departments were struggling to govern
          mobile app installation on the plethora of devices now in the
          workplace due to the popularity of
          <em>Bring your own Device</em> initiatives. In addition, employees'
          began to demand from their enterprise mobile environment the same
          attention to design that they were accustomed to in consumer apps.
        </p>

        <p>
          I joined the Frontend Engineering that was implementing the mobile
          webapp for application provisioning. Our visual designer had developed
          responsive screens that would lay out efficiently on the wide range of
          screen sizes we need to support.
        </p>

        <figure class="float-right">
          <div
            class="image img-3by2"

          <figcaption class="caption">

          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
          The designs indicated that the "launchpad" screen should allow users
          to organize their apps using drag-and-drop interactions, which they
          were accustomed to as iOS and Android users. This turned out to be
          very challenging, because the HTML 5 Drag-and-Drop API was not widely
          implemented across Android devices, the typical dynamic reflowing
          animation that we've come to expect did not perform adequately on
          lower-spec devices, particularly Android tablets with large screens
          but inadequate GPU resources.
        </p>

        <p>
          Taking these technical constraints in to account, I designed a
          drag-and-drop <q>slide sorter</q> interaction that was performant on
          all the devices we had in our testing lab. Some of the design
          decisions made based on technical limitations were:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>all animations specified in CSS, not Javascript</li>
          <li>no animations performed while the user was dragging an icon</li>
          <li>
            all transparency effects (e.g., drop shadows) removed from the icon
            being dragged, to reduce the load on the compositing engine
          </li>
          <li>
            the one animation that remained, which was to rearrange the screen
            after the user dropped the icon in place, was accomplished by
            animating just one value (the width of the icon being inserted) and
            letting the layout engine compute all the other icons' locations.
          </li>
