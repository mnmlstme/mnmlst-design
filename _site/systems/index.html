          <a href="https://orbitalinsight.com">Orbital Insight</a>'s data
          products each require their own UI to help customers evaluate and draw
          insights from the data. Since customers often subscribe to multiple
          products, we wanted to maintain a consistent experience across the
          products. This became a challenge once we had a team of UI Engineers,
          each working on a different product line.

        <p>
          To address this issue, we developed a design system which includes
          common UI elements and data visualization primitives, all coded in
          React. The design system is maintained as part of the production code
          base, so any changes made to the components are immediately apparent
          in the examples rendered in the design system. Keeping the design
          system files alongside the source code also makes it much more
          convenient for the UI team to keep the documentation up-to-date, and
          facilitates use of the design system as a testing framework for the
          components themselves.

        <p>
          The tooling for the design system is
          <a href="https://github.com/mnmlstme/patternbook">Patternbook</a>, an
          open-source side project I had created. In Patternbook, components are
          documented in Markdown, and can include code examples that are
          rendered inline alongside source code and data context. A shared
          Patternbook server is deployed off the <tt>git</tt> master branch.
          Developers can also run Patternbook in their own development branch,
          in which case, source code changes are immediately visible in the
          browser via <tt>webpack</tt> hot module reload.
        </p>

        <p>
          Data visualization is a major part of the UI work at Orbital Insight.
          The UI Engineers were familiar with D3, but we wanted Data Scientists
          and Product Managers to design visualizations directly and iterate
          more rapidly on those designs. The design system therefore includes a
          fair number of data visualization components that can be combined to
          create charts and maps. The team appreciated the approach taken by D3
          (which abstracts out the concepts of series, axis, legend, scale,
          etc., as separate layers which can be combined to create a wide
          variety of visualizations from a fairly small set of primitives), so
          we created an analogous set of React components, many of which were
          simply wrappers around the D3 equivalents. Designing visualizations in
          React this way is more intuitive than using D3 in Javascript, because
          the definitions tend to be more declarative or functional.

        <p>
          The End-User Computing UI team at VMware used a variety of
          technologies to render their web applications, both server-side and
          in-browser. Users, however, were unaware of this because the pages all
          looked consistent; styling was controlled by static CSS files. So when
          it came to document and formalize our design system, it was clear that
          effort would be focused on CSS.

        <p>
          I had previously created
          <a href="https://github.com/mnmlstme/styleboard">Styleboard</a>
          which analyzes the selectors in CSS files to extract the design
          patterns, based on modular CSS naming conventions and
          <a
            href="https://github.com/mnmlstme/styleboard/blob/master/StyleDoc.md"
            >doc strings</a
          >
          embedded in CSS comments. The team was already starting to apply the
          principles of modular CSS (using SCSS) in an effort to be able to
          share CSS definitions between applications. So a CSS-based design
          system, called Xydeco, was initiated based on Styleboard.
        </p>

        <figure class="float-right">
          <div
            class="image img-16by10"

            <a class="link img-link" href="fullsize/message.png">

            The Styleboard entry for <tt>message</tt>, an Angular directive
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
          While the team eventually standardized on AngularJS for all new
          projects, and many of the components in Xydeco were reimplemented as
          Angular directives, there was no need to migrate Xydeco to Angular.
          The same CSS classes were still being used from Angular, and
          Styleboard was easily adapted to accept examples coded in Angular
          rather than static HTML.
