          The twentieth century saw the commoditization of housing, normalized
          to what was then the typical living situation: the nuclear family. In
          the first two decades of the twenty-first century, family types
          proliferated and migration patterns globalized. Today, as a result,
          developer-built commoditized housing fails to meet the needs of a
          diverse and increasingly nomadic population.
        </p>

        <p>
          The demand for inexpensive, clean, and safe temporary-to-permanent
          housing has largely gone unmet. While there are a plethora of reasons,
          the fundamental issues revolve around a reductionist conception of
          <em>domus</em> combined with colonial notions of land rights.

          In this project, I explored novel approaches to solving the problem of
          nomadic housing for personas ranging from economic refugees to young
          single professionals, college students to full-time tourists. Perhaps
          the most successful of these designs is for a modular tensile
          structure, based on Buckminster Fuller's <em>tensegrity</em> system
          for enclosing a volume with the lowest mass of construction materials.

          My investigation of novel building types was facilitated by working
          back and forth between diverse media, including 3D models, scale
          models, pencil sketches, and animations. Anthropological studies of
          various nomadic populations also stimulated exploration and reduced
          personal bias in evaluating alternatives.

          I am a California Licensed Architect who practiced for several years
          designing public school facilities in the San Francisco Bay Area. A
          large part of this time was spent updating a Career-Technical
          Education Facility in San Jose, which trained secondary-school
          students in a wide range of curricula including Web Design, Solar
          Panel Installation, Hybrid Vehicle Repair, Forensic Science, Video
          Production, and Culinary Arts.

          The facility consisted of seven 25,000sf buildings constructed in the
          1970s. Although the brutalist concrete structure of the building was
          still sound, the instructional spaces no longer served the needs of
          modern career-technical education, which trains students for careers
          that didn't even exist 40 years ago. Any modifications would also
          trigger code compliance for Accessibility, Seismic, and Fire/Life
          Safety.

          The large open spaces available once the existing buildings were
          gutted provided a clean slate upon which to design the new instruction
          areas. For each curriculum, we consulted with the instructors, many of
          whom are also practitioners in their respective fields, to verify that
          the facilities we provided were typical of the work environments that
          the students would find themselves in after graduation. This user
          research phase of the design process was essential to the program's
          ultimate success. At the same time, the regularity and repetition of
          the existing structure allowed us to systematize design details, which
          made both design and construction more efficient, and allowed a higher
          portion of the budget to be devoted to providing unique educational
          opportunities to the students.
